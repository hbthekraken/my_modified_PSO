This repository will have some Python code that can be used to model a mathematical optimization problem to minimize a single objective function using a (heaviliy) modified version of particle swarm optimization.
Further explanations, code changes&improvements will follow :)

Now, a document is available as a PDF that can be viewed on GitHub. [Please check.](/Nonlinear%20Constrained%20Continuous%20Optimization%20with%20OptimizationModel.pdf)
